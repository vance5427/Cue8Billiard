# Cue8Billiard
A custom billiards based game using using just the cue and 8 ball. Don't let the 8 ball stop rolling on your turn!

Play with a Full Pool Copy game of pool I found online, or check out the in progress version of the original Cue8Billiard in Draft 1.

This game is built in Unity and can be played easily from the UnityHub, but I am planning to host it on the web, and maybe eventually on mobile.

More work needed on game dynamics theory. How to allow users to make a move 

Thanks!
